# Facial recognition using Siamese Networks with score level fusion
This project was created as a part of the mobile biometric course in the CS program at the University of South Florida by Vardhan, Bharat, and Lokesh.

The goal of the project is to implement facial recognition using Siamese Networks with score level fusion. The dataset used for training and testing are faces of my classmates, and the dataset is not available to the public. We used the Inception ResNet V2 model for extracting 128 facial feature embeddings for each image in the training dataset. These embeddings were then used for recognizing the persons in the test set.

Note: The dataset used in this project is not publicly available. Therefore, the code will not work without the dataset.


## Results
A preliminary accuracy of 84% was achieved on the validation dataset with this method. For more details on the results and analysis, please refer to the report.pdf file.

## Credits
This project was created by Vardhan, Bharat, and Lokesh. The team would like to acknowledge the contributions of the mobile biometric course instructor [Dr. Tempestt Neal]([https://github.com/tempestt-neal]) and the University of South Florida.
